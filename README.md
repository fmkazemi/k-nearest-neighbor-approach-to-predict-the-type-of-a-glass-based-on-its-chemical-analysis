Implement k-nearest neighbor approach to predict the type of a glass based on its chemical analysis
The data set is provided as a tab-delimited text file and consists of 214 instances, 9 attributes and 6 classes. The data set was obtained from the UCI Repository of Machine Learning Database. 
For this question, I uploaded the answer of the following questions:
a) The definition of the distance function used.
b) The pseudo-code of your k-nearest neighbor implementation.
c) A brief description of how cross-validation was implemented.
d) Precision-recall curves for three different values of k and random prediction. All curves should be plotted together. Precision and recall values should be obtained by 5-fold cross-validation. Use as confidence threshold the proportion of neighbors agreeing in the predicted class. At least one of the k-nearest neighbor has to perform better than random.
